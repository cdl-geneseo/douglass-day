# How Do I Transcribe?

Every Douglass Day, participants, wherever they are, work together to transcribe historical documents that help tell the story of Black activism in the United States. The 2024 transcribe-a-thon focuses on the [correspondence of Frederick Douglass in the Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/search/?fa=partof:frederick+douglass+papers:+general+correspondence,+1841-1912).

Transcribers will use the Library of Congress' [By the People](https://crowd.loc.gov/) platform to do the work.

## Account registration

You can transcribe *without registering an account on the By the People website*. But creating an account will enable you to track your transcriptions and participate as a reviewer as well as a transcriber. We recommend it!

## Overview

Different transcription projects have different aims. The Library of Congress' By the People project is aimed primarily at improving the searchability, readability, and accessibility of documents in their collection for people who use screen readers or other assistive technology.

The project also seeks to honor the document creators' historical reality by preserving the original spelling, grammar, and punctuation in their documents.

## Detailed instructions

The By the People website has [detailed instructions](https://crowd.loc.gov/get-started/how-to-transcribe/) to guide you in transcribing documents in a way that meets their goals. Again, you don't need to create an account to start transcribing. You can jump right in.

The site also explains [how to review transcribed documents](https://crowd.loc.gov/get-started/how-to-review/). You do need to register an account in order to review transcribed documents.

## Limbering up

You don't need to wait for Douglass Day to start developing your transcribing skills. You can dive into any one of the LOC's [active transcription campaigns](https://crowd.loc.gov/campaigns-topics/) right now to get a feel for how to do the work. If you start flexing your fingers before February 14, you'll be ready to transcribe Douglass and help others in the room.
