## Transcription

The Douglass Day main website has a handy [transcription guide](https://douglassday.org/how-to-transcribe/) that you can consult online or download and print. The explainer currently on the site is for Douglass Day 2022, but it's broadly applicable to the transcription process generally. When the explainer for this year's Douglass Day goes up on the site, we'll make sure that the link here is current as well.
