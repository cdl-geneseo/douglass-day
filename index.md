# Join us!

Join SUNY Geneseo's Center for Digital Learning, Center for Integrative Learning, and Teaching and Learning Center **this February 14 from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m.** in the **College Union Hunt Room** to celebrate *[Douglass Day 2023!](https://douglassday.org)*

We'd love it if you'd [take a moment to RSVP](https://forms.gle/71d9Uax4yKPBkjHh7) so we know how many folks in the SUNY Geneseo community to expect.

Described by its national [organizers](https://douglassday.org/about/) as a day of "collective action for Black history," Douglass Day gives participants the opportunity to [create communal spaces for remembering and preserving Black history with Black communities](https://douglassday.org/about/principles/) in ways that promote critical reflection and joy.

Each year, the Douglass Day organizers invite people everywhere to help transcribe digitized collections important to Black history. This year, participants will help transcribe the papers of activist, abolitionist, women's rights advocate, writer, teacher, and lawyer [Mary Ann Shadd Cary](https://www.nps.gov/people/mary-ann-shadd-cary.htm) (1823-1893), [the first Black woman in North America to edit a weekly newspaper](https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/mary-ann-shadd-cary/). (The Douglass Day website has a [wealth of additional information about Shadd Cary's life and importance](https://douglassday.org/shadd/).)

Never transcribed historical documents before? *No worries&mdash;it's easy, and we'll show you how!* We hope you'll join us this Valentine's Day for a joyous celebration of Black history, activism, and digital preservation.
