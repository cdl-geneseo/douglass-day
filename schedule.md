# Schedule for Douglass Day 2024

<img src="assets/power.webp" alt="Frederick Douglass headshot and motto 'Power concedes nothing without a demand'" style="float: left; width: 30%; margin-right: 12px;"/>We'll gather in the **College Union Ballroom** a little before **12 noon**.

At noon, we'll launch the live stream from the [national organizers](https://douglassday.org) and begin our celebration of Frederick Douglass, Black history and activism, and our own community. We'll participate together in the transcription activity. 

From noon until 3 p.m., we'll alternate between watching the live stream and engaging in transcription and other activities.

Organizers will be on hand to help with transcription, but remember that there are many ways to contribute&mdash;from transcribing handwritten or printed documents to simply identifying names in the documents&mdash;and that you don't have to overthink accuracy: it's fine just to do the best job you can.

If you're not able to join us in the Ballroom, you can watch the live stream and participate in transcription on your own device, wherever you are.

### 12:00 PM- 12:30 PM EST: Live Broadcast

We'll join the organizers in singing <a href="https://douglassday.org/anthem/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">“Lift Every Voice and Sing”</a>, receive an overview of the program, and listen to speakers on Douglass.
