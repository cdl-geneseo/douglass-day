# Schedule for Douglass Day 2024

<img src="assets/power.webp" alt="Frederick Douglass headshot and motto 'Power concedes nothing without a demand'" style="float: left; width: 30%; margin-right: 12px;"/>We have a full day of activities lined up for Douglass Day 2024, with a presentation and musical performances in the morning and a transcribe-a-thon in the afternoon. 

Organizers will be on hand to help with transcription, but remember that there are many ways to contribute&mdash;from transcribing handwritten or printed documents to simply identifying names in the documents&mdash;and that you don't have to overthink accuracy: it's fine just to do the best job you can.

If you're not able to join us in the Ballroom, you can watch the live stream and participate in transcription on your own device, wherever you are.
