# Douglass Day 2024 at Geneseo

On [Douglass Day](https://douglassday.org) 2024, SUNY Geneseo faculty, staff, and students transcribed [correspondence of Frederick Douglass](https://www.loc.gov/search/?fa=partof:frederick+douglass+papers:+general+correspondence,+1841-1912) in the archives of the Library of Congress.

We also heard from Antoine McDonald, librarian in the Local History and Genealogy division of the Rochester Public Library, will join us via Zoom to tell us about the [Archive of Black History and Culture](https://roccitylibrary.org/archive-of-black-history-culture/).

And we had wonderful musical performances by the Geneseo Chamber Singers and Wayne Anthony Norwood and the Children of God.

<!-- returns on **February 14, 2024**, sponsored by the [Center for Digital Learning](https://geneseo.edu/cdl), the [Center for Integrative Learning](https://www.geneseo.edu/cil), and the [Department of Music &amp; Musical Theatre](https://www.geneseo.edu/music).

Described by its national [organizers](https://douglassday.org/about/) as a day of "collective action for Black history," every year Douglass Day gives participants the opportunity to [create communal spaces for remembering and preserving Black history with Black communities](https://douglassday.org/about/principles/) in ways that promote critical reflection and joy.

Each year, the Douglass Day organizers invite people everywhere to help transcribe digitized collections important to Black history. Previous "transcribe-a-thons" have focused on records from the [Colored Conventions project](https://coloredconventions.org/) and papers of Anna Julia Cooper, Mary Church Terrell, and Mary Ann Shadd Cary.

This year's transcribe-a-thon will feature [correspondence of Frederick Douglass himself](https://www.loc.gov/search/?fa=partof:frederick+douglass+papers:+general+correspondence,+1841-1912) in the archives of the Library of Congress.
